# Seismic Processing Tools

Welcome to a, hopefully, comprehensive resource for **open-source seismic data analysis and modeling tools**. This purpose of this site is to help researchers, geophysicists, and engineers discover, evaluate, and utilize high-quality software packages for seismic data processing. 

There are other existing resources for seismology, with a focus on deeper Earth and crustal seismology (e.g., [awesome-seismology](https://github.com/schipp/awesome-seismology)) and [core-man's links](https://core-man.github.io/link/post/codes/#synthetic-seismograms). SEG also has the [GEOPHYSICS source-code archive](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Software:GEOPHYSICS_source-code_archive) and other [free exploration-geophysical software](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Software:Home_page). But we wanted to try to capture things for near-surface applications. 

## About This Resource

The field of seismic data processing encompasses a wide range of techniques and methodologies. This site organizes tools by their primary application areas, making it easier to find the right software for your specific needs. We try to ensure that each tool listing includes:

- **Repository information** and GitHub links
- **Maintenance status** and development activity
- **Programming language** and dependencies
- **Key features** and capabilities
- **Installation guidance** and documentation quality

## Submit Resource Suggestions

> **üìù Have a tool to recommend?** Help expand this resource by [submitting a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dylanmikesell/seismic-software/issues/new) with details about open-source seismic processing tools you'd like to see featured. Include the tool name, repository link, and brief description to help the community discover valuable resources.
